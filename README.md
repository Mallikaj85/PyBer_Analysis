# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this written report is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Using the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries, this report will include multiple-line graphs of total weekly fares for each city type. The report will showcase an analysis using rideshare date from three different city types: rural, urban and suburban to determine the similarities and differences among the three city types.

## Results:

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.


Analysis for rural city types:

- Total of 78 drivers with an average fare per driver of $55.49
- Total of 125 rides with an average fare per ride of $34.62
- Total fares earned was $4,327.93

Analysis for suburban city types:

Total of 490 drivers with an average fare per driver of $39.50
Total of 625 rides with an average fare per ride of $30.97
Total fares earned was $19,356.33

Analysis for urban city types:

Total of 2,405 drivers with an average fare per driver of $16.57
Total of 1625 rides with an average fare per ride of $24.53
Total fares earned was $39,854.38

Total Fare by City Type

In the graph above shows the distinct separation of Rural, Urban and Suburban city types.  The Urban cities fare is the highest and consistent between the months of January till April.  The Rural cities fare is the lowest of the other two city types and similar to Urban and Suburban city types trend, the fares never intersect.  Although the fares never intersect, the Urban fares start at average of $1,800 and continued to increase as the months went by to ~$2,300.  The Suburban fares on the other hand started ~$1,000, the trend was not consistently profitable as the fare dropped in March and even lower at mid-April.  The Rural fares started at ~$200, consistent increase and drop of fares till the end of April. One similarity is fare spike of the three city types is at the end of February.


## Summary:

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)


The analysis showed that urban city types have the largest number of drivers; they also had the lowest average fare and lowest average fare per driver. Rural city types had the least number of drivers but the highest average fare per ride and per driver. From this analysis it appears that those who use rideshare services in rural areas pay more than individuals who use rideshare services in urban areas. Additional analysis of RyBer rideshare data will be important to better understand and make recommendations based on any disparities.

1. Analysis of rideshare data by mileage to compare the fare per mileage. This would allow us to see if individuals using rideshare services in rural areas are paying more for going more miles.

2. Analysis of how many rides a driver gives, on average, on a daily and a weekly basis. From the data we can see that drivers in urban areas make less per average fare, however it could be that they are making more per hours based on the number of rides they give a day.

3. Analysis of length of time an individual has to wait from the moment they request a ride until the moment their ride picks them up. This will help better understand how well the current number of drivers in each city type is able to serve the residents of their cities.

4. Analysis of whether any drivers are registered in one city type but drive in another (for example are there any drivers registered in a rural city who actually work as a PyBer driver in rural or suburban city types).
